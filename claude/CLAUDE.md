## Development

- Don't use a devcontainer, even if the project documentation provides instructions on using the devcontainer. Run mix commands directly on my host.
- If you're going to run a `mix` command on a project, always run `mix deps.get` beforehand. 

## Plans

- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any.
- When creating new code that includes naming something, highlight the new names that you created and ask for confirmation.

## Focus

- Don't ever make extra code changes to solve problems that you find that are unrelated to the piece of work we're focused on. Instead, mention the problem and ask me if I want to create a new Github issue for it.
